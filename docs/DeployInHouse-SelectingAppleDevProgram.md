<b>OBJECTIVES</b>

* Choose your Apple Developer Program
</div>


You need to have a valid Apple Developer account to distribute an iOS app :

* Apple Developer Program – $99/year 
* Apple Developer Enterprise Program – $299/year

The main difference is that the Apple Developer Enterprise Program provides resources ONLY for developing and distributing <b>proprietary, in-house apps</b> to employees.

On the other hand, the Apple Developer program allows you to distribute your app <b>on the App Store</b>.
