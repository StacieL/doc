<b>TIP:</b>
* You can use any cloud storage service to distribute your app as soon as it is secured (Dropbox, Google Drive...)
</div>


## STEP 2. Build a link to send and download the app

To make your app available to all your employees you must provide a link like that :

```
itms-services://?action=download-manifest&url=<Manifest.plist URL>

```

You can send a email that includes that link, embed it in an html page or even create QR code to scan with your iPhone to install your app.

Here a simple example of it can be done :

When you first open an enterprise app that you've manually installed, you see a notification that the developer of the app isn't trusted on your device. You can dismiss this message, but then you can't open the app.

After you dismiss this message, you can establish trust for the app developer. Tap Settings > General > Profiles or Profiles & Device Management. Under the "Enterprise App" heading, you see a profile for the developer.

Tap the name of the developer profile under the Enterprise App heading to establish trust for this developer.
