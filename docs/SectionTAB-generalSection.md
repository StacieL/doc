* Organization’s Name: your company’s name or your personal name.
* Organization identifier: your organization’s bundle identifier. will be used to identify your app. The product name you enter are concatenated to create the default “Bundle ID” using reverse domain name service notation. This bundle ID needs to be unique to your app.
 

For example, imagine your company’s name is “MyCompany” and your app’s name “MyApp”, in this case you could choose a company identifier like “com.MyCompany”
