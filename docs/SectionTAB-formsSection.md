In this section you will choose a List Form and Detail Form model for each Table.

4D for iOS provide various templates with custom transition effects to build nice and clean iOS apps.

Let’s analyze this screen and describe it, from the top to bottom:

* List Forms and Detail Forms tabs: switch between list and detail form definition for each table
* Published tables: all tables that have been published in the Structure section are available here
* Template and content definition: switch between template selection and content definition clicking on a table

## LIST FORM DEFINITION

As default, a basic template is selected as List Form and Detail From but doesn’t include any content.

Simply select a template for your first table.
When you have chosen a template, the content definition screen appears.
You can then drag and drop the fields from the Field List on the left to the Model displayed at the right.
Most of the List Forms includes optional Search fields and Section fields to sort your records in the app and make search.

 

## DETAIL FORM DEFINITION

In the same way as for List Form definition, select the template that suits you, and drag and drop fields into your Detail Form
