Here you define a subset of your physical structure to replicate for mobile devices selecting tables and fields.

* Selected tables will be automatically added to the Tabbar of your app
* Selected fields will be available later when it will be time to define the content of your list and detail forms.
 

To help you define your app structure, filters, as well as a search engine are available to make easy tables and fields selection.

You can publish a selection of fields pressing spacebar instead of select them one by one
