When you're satified that your application is ready, you can launch the project in the Simulator and test your project.

Letâ€™s look at the Build tab options in detail:

* Build and Run: Launches the application in the Simulator.

* iPhone X: The default Simulator. Clicking here will reveal a dropdown list with all available simulators.

* Project: Reveals a dropdown list where you can open the project or product folder, or open the product with Xcode.

* Install: Installs the application on a connected device.

Select a Simulator to build your application on, and press the Build and Run button.
