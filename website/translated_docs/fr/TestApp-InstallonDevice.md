If you want to publish your application in the App Store, you'll need to create an Apple Developer Program.

Depending on your objectives and preferences, you can choose to create a: * [Free Apple Developer Program](Freedeveloperaccount.html) only for testing * [Apple Developer Program for organization](RegisterOrganization.html) or [individual](RegisterIndividual.html) for an App Store Deployment * [Apple Enterprise Developer Program](RegisterAppleDeveloperEnterpriseProgram.html) (if you deploy your app in-house).

Let's go through the process...

## STEP 1. ACCOUNT CREATION

* Apple ID: Create your apple ID. If you donâ€™t already have one, click [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835).

* Developer Account: Choose an Apple Developer Program (for organizations or individuals) for App Store deployment or Apple developer Enterprise program (for in-house deployment).

* [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835): If you don't already have the latest version installed, you can get it in the App Store. Download, install, and open it to install all components.
* [Apple configurator 2](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-configurator-2/id1037126344): If you don't already have the latest version installed, you can get it in the App Store. Download and install it.
