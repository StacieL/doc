When you're satisfied that your application is ready, you can launch it in the Simulator to test it.

Letâ€™s look at the Build tab options in detail:

* **Build and Run:** Launches the application in the Simulator.

* **iPhone X:** The default Simulator. Clicking here will reveal a dropdown list with all available simulators.

* **Project:** Reveals a dropdown list where you can open the project or product folder, or open the product with Xcode.

* **Install:** Installs the application on a connected device.

Select a Simulator to build and test your application on, and press the **Build and Run** button.
