## FULLY INTEGRATED TO 4D

With 4D for iOS, you can easily create a new mobile project directly from 4D, without the need of any prior expertise building native iOS apps

## CREATE NATIVE APPS

* We hide the complexity and generate from 4D - in a totally transparent way - an Xcode project in pure Swift and optimized UI/UX
* One of the strength of 4D for iOS is that you have the opportunity to create an unlimited number of apps from different subsets of your database according to your needs abd goals

## SUPPORT OFFLINE MODE

* All your data are embeded in your app and are available without any internet connection

## OPEN SOLUTION

* 4D for iOS generates a real Xcode project. You can reopen it in Xcode and continue to work on it
* All table and List & Detail Forms are embedded into the generated app and are editable
