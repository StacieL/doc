This is where you'll define short and long labels, as well as icons, for your tables and fields.

* **Short and long labels:** Long and short labels are used according to the available space in the template (to optimize space and avoid overcrowding the tab bar).
* **Icons:** 4D for iOS provides a large library of embedded icons to meet your needs. These include icons for commerce, finance, education, government, health, industry, real estate, services, etc.

<div class = "tips">
<b>TIP:</b>

To keep everything consistent, default icons are generated for blank fields if at least one icon has been defined for a field. 

You can also leave your the icon area empty if you donâ€™t want to display icons in your application.
