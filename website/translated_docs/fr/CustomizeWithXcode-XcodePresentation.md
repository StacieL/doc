Xcode displays various areas that we're going to review:

## THE TOOLBAR

- Run and Stop buttons are located on the left side of the toolbar. Pressing the Run button will build, and run, and launch your application in the selected iOS Simulator. ![alt-text](assets/customize-with-xcode/Toolbar-Build-and-Run-Xcode-4D-for-iOS.png)

- The dropdown menu next to the Stop button indicates which build target you want to run and which Simulator is being used. ![alt-text](assets/customize-with-xcode/Toolbar-Target-simulator-Xcode-4D-for-iOS.png)

- On the right side of the toolbar, you'll find View buttons to show and hide the various areas. ![alt-text](assets/customize-with-xcode/Toolbar-View-buttons-Xcode-4D-for-iOS.png)

## THE EDITOR AREA

![alt-text](assets/customize-with-xcode/Editor-Xcode-4D-for-iOS.png)

This is where the coding happens when a Swift file is selected. It changes when a Storyboard file is selected: the Interface Builder View appears.

## INTERFACE BUILDER AREA

![alt-text](assets/customize-with-xcode/Interface-Builder-Xcode-4D-for-iOS.png)

This is a graphical interface which allows you to build a Storyboard or XIB file. On the left, all of your scenes are available.

## THE UTILITY AREA

![alt-text](assets/customize-with-xcode/Utility-Xcode-4D-for-iOS.png)

- **Inspector panel**: Provides details about the selected file in your project navigator. The Inspector panel is very similar to the Property list.
- **Library panel**: When using the Interface Builder, you can drag UI elements from here to add them to your user interface.

## THE DEBUG AREA

This area displays the output and the state of various variables when running your application.

## THE NAVIGATION AREA

This area includes several tabs. The most important of which are:

- **Navigation tab**: Includes all files necessary for your application to work properly. ![alt-text](assets/customize-with-xcode/Project-Navigation-Editor-Xcode-4D-for-iOS.png)

- **Search navigator tab**: Allows searching all files in the project. ![alt-text](assets/customize-with-xcode/Search-Navigator-Xcode-4D-for-iOS.png)

- **Issue navigator tab**: Displays all errors in an iOS project.

- Errors in red are critical issues that need to be corrected in order to build your application. 
- Errors in yellow are warnings about issues which have the potential to cause problems but do not block the building of the application. 

You can click on errors and warnings to visualize them in the project. ![alt-text](assets/customize-with-xcode/Issue-Navigator-Xcode-4D-for-iOS.png)

Next, we're going to focus on the files included in your 4D for iOS application from the Project navigation tab.
