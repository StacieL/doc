If you want to publish your application in the App Store, you'll need to create an Apple Developer Program.

Depending on your objectives and preferences, you can choose to create a: * [Free Apple Developer Program](free-developer-account.html) only for testing * [Apple Developer Program for organization](register-apple-developer-program-organization.html) or [individual](register-apple-developer-program-individual.html) for an App Store Deployment * [Apple Enterprise Developer Program](register-apple-developer-enterprise-program.html) (if you deploy your app in-house).

Let's go through the process...

## STEP 1. Account creation

* **Apple ID**: Create your apple ID. If you donâ€™t already have one, click [here](https://appleid.apple.com/account#!&page=create).

* **Developer Account**: Choose an Apple Developer Program (for organizations or individuals) for App Store deployment or Apple developer Enterprise program (for in-house deployment).

* **[Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835)**: If you don't already have the latest version installed, you can get it in the App Store. Download, install, and open it to install all components.
* **[Apple configurator 2](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-configurator-2/id1037126344)**: If you don't already have the latest version installed, you can get it in the App Store. Download and install it.
