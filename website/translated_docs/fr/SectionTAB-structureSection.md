This section displays all of your database tables and fields exposed by 4D Mobile.

![alt-text](assets/4DforiOSOverview/Structure-section-4D-for-iOS.png)

Here, you can define a subset of your physical structure to replicate for mobile devices by selecting specific tables and fields. The selected:

* tables will be automatically added to the tabs of your application.
* fields will be available later when it's time to define your list and detail forms.

To help you define your application's structure, multiple filters and a search engine are available to make it easy to select your tables and field.

<div class = "tips">
<b>TIP:</b>

You can publish a selection of fields by pressing the spacebar rather than selecting them one by one.
