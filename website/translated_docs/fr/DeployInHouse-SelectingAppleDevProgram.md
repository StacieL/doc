<b>OBJECTIVES</b>

* Choose your Apple Developer Program
</div>

You need to have a valid Apple Developer account to **distribute an iOS app** :

* [Apple Developer Program for organization](register-apple-developer-program-organization.html) or [for individual](register-apple-developer-program-individual.html) – $99/year 
* [Apple Enterprise Developer Program](register-apple-developer-enterprise-program.html) – $299/year

The main difference is that the Apple Developer Enterprise Program provides resources ONLY for developing and distributing **proprietary, in-house apps** to employees.

On the other hand, the Apple Developer program allows you to distribute your app **on the App Store**.

For test purposes you can choose to use a [Free Apple Developer Program](free-developer-account.html)

Here is a chart that compares the different levels of developer membership :
